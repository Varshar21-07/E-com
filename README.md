# E-com Project

## How to Run the Project

This project consists of two parts: a client-side React application and a server-side Express backend.

### Running the Client (Frontend)

1. Navigate to the `client` directory:
   ```bash
   cd client
   ```
2. Install dependencies (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. The client will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port Vite uses).

### Running the Server (Backend)

1. Navigate to the `server` directory:
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```
2. Install dependencies (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the server in development mode with nodemon:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. The server will start and listen on the configured port (usually `http://localhost:5000` or as configured).

This setup allows you to develop and test both frontend and backend locally.
